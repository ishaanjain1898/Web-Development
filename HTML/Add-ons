White space collapsing - 
      When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. 
       Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too.


Tags that make the text seems to be in Italic- <i>, <em>, <cite>, <dfn>, <address>



Images

Three rules of Creating Images
•	Save images in the right format
•	Save images at the right size
•	Use the correct resolution

Preferred image type

Picture that have many colours in it like scenery: JPEG image
Pictures that have very less colours like logo: GIF or PNG

Image Dimension: The image should be saved at the same width and height as required to appear in page.

Image Resolution: Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. 
The higher the image resolution, the larger the size of the file.


SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics are a relative new format used to display vector images directly on the web (eliminating 
the need to create bitmap version of them), however its use is not yet widespread.

Block elements - adds <br> before and after themselfs.

<Small> Tag :-
This makes text one size small. If we put this tag "small" in "h1" the text still appears bigger
than "h2" but smaller than "h1". (about 0.8)

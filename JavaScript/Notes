Identifier 
The rules for creating an identifier in JavaScript are, the name of the identifier should not be any pre-defined keyword, the first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters may be any letter or digit or an underscore or dollar sign. Variable are case sensitive.



Switch case – In JavaScript we use numbers, strings, Boolean value and more

Eg.	var name=Ishaan
	Switch (name+ “Jain”)
	{
		case Ishaan Jain: document.write(“True”);
		break;
	}
